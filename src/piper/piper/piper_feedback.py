# still" into a real movement whenever the joint currently sits outside its
# range.
#
# Verified against the driver with GetAllMotorAngleLimitMaxSpd() (CAN 0x473).
# Two deviations from the JointCtrl docstring were found and the driver wins:
#   joint6  driver reports +-180 where the docstring says +-120;
#   joint2  lower bound widened 0 -> -2.0 on 2026-09-23
#           (MotorAngleLimitMaxSpdSet, CAN 0x474) so that a gravity sag onto
#           the mechanical stop no longer sits fully outside the commandable
#           range.  Applied to all four arms, whose factory limits were
#           identical (can_fl, can_mr, can_fr, can_ml all read back the same
#           table).
#   joint3  upper bound widened 0 -> +1.2, then +1.2 -> +2.0 the same day, for
#           the same reason: both masters settle at +2.05 and +2.10 degrees, so
#           +1.2 left the follower unable to match the master pose at all.  The
#           new bound sits 0.1 degree below the highest angle a joint was
#           actually observed to reach (2.102), so it cannot point at an
#           unreachable position.  Motor angle limits step in 0.1 degree, which
#           is why these are round values.
# These limits live in driver flash, so they are per-arm and can be changed:
# after any MotorAngleLimitMaxSpdSet, update this table or re-read the arm,

    Jerk-limited smoothing stage: the stable form of a quintic interpolation.

    Every joint keeps (position, velocity, acceleration) and each cycle walks
    one step of a cascaded loop whose poles are placed at ``-bandwidth``:
    the position error becomes a desired velocity, that becomes a desired
    acceleration, that becomes a jerk.  Because jerk is the inner-most
    command, the **acceleration is continuous** -- there are no acceleration
    jumps, which is what a quintic segment buys and what this stage is for.

    Velocity feed-forward (``velocities``, normally the One Euro derivative
    estimate) keeps a steady drag tracked without lag, so smoothing does not
    cost tracking.  What it does cost is the braking distance: when the
    reference stops abruptly the tracker overshoots by about ``v / bandwidth``
    (7.6 degrees for a 150 deg/s stop at the default 15 rad/s).

    Limits are hard: acceleration and jerk never exceed the values passed in.
    The velocity ceiling can be exceeded by a fraction of a percent (0.35% was
